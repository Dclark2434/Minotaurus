# MINOTAURUS: THE LABYRINTH AWAKENS
Welcome to the repository for MINOTAURUS, a simple text-based adventure game that I've developed as part of my learning journey in Python.

### Overview
This game isn't about flashy graphics or intricate mechanics. Instead, it's about getting back to basics. As a beginner project, MINOTAURUS has helped me delve deeper into Python's conditional logic, namely the use of if, elif, and else statements. I've also tried to weave in a bit of storytelling for good measure.

### What to Expect
Simple Gameplay: Make choices by typing in your response. Your decisions will dictate the path you take and the outcome of your journey.
Multiple Endings: Based on your choices, you'll encounter various endings. Can you find them all?  
Satirical: There's a press.md in the repository that's written in a very over-the-top style. I enjoyed writing it and was inspired by the early works of John Romero.

### How to Play
Clone the repository or download the game files.  
Run main.py to start the game.  
Follow the on-screen prompts and make your choices.  

### Learning Outcomes
Working on this project, I've:
-Gained a better understanding of conditional statements in Python.  
-Experimented with organizing and structuring a basic game flow.  
-Practiced importing and using modules.  
-Had a blast exploring the possibilities, even within such a simple framework.  

### Feedback and Contribution
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions. As this is a beginner project, there's always room for improvement or expansion. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you spot something or have ideas!

### Final Words
I appreciate you checking out MINOTAURUS. This project was as much about the learning experience as it was about creating something fun. I hope you enjoy it, and perhaps even find some inspiration for your projects.

Happy adventuring!
